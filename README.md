# dynamic_resume
Auto generate resume based on the position you are applying/hiring, using concise practical resume design and manual configuration.


## Project Progress
- Because the plan was to use **Streamit** to build the page, so there are **python** codes in the folder `src/`
- The folder `resume_config/` are meant for **manual customization**

## Todo:
- Using **FastAPI and HTMX** is more interesting, and allow further collaboration.
-> Folder `src/`: Migrate **Python** code.
